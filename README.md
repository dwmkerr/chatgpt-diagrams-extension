## Quickstart

Clone, install dependencies and build the extension:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:dwmkerr/chatgpt-diagrams-extension.git
npm install
npm run build
```

Open [Chrome Extensions](chrome://extensions), choose 'Load Unpacked' and select the `./dist` folder. Now open https://chat.openai.com/ and enter a prompt such as:

> Use mermaid.js to create a sequence diagram showing how state can be persisted for a chrome extension, and how state can be passed between files.

Press the 'Show Diagram' button in the code sample to render the diagram inline:

## Developer Guide

[Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) is recommended to ensure that you are using the latest long-term support version of node.

Ensure you are using Node LTS, then install dependencies:

```bash
nvm use --lts
npm install
```

To run in local development mode, which will automatically reload when changes are made, use:

```bash
npm start
```

Load the unpacked extension in your browser from the `./dist` folder.

### Code Structure

- manifest
- key files
- lib

### Running the Sample Pages

The following command runs a local webserver, serving the content at [`./samples`](./samples). This makes it easy to test locally, without internet connectivity and without having to regularly log into ChatGPT:

```bash
make serve-samples
```

The sample page is served at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Manifest

Note that the `version` field is omitted from [`manifest.json`](./src/manifest.json). When fields like `version` are omitted, rollup copies them over from the `package.json` file.

### Testing

Test Files
JSDOM
Jest

### Debugging

There seems to be an issue with how the sourcemaps are generated by Rollup at the moment, meaning that regardless of how the [`output.sourcemap` option](https://rollupjs.org/configuration-options/#output-sourcemap) is specified, sourcemaps are not loaded by the browser.

### Verifying Pull Requests

To verify that the code builds, the tests pass and the release package can be created run the commands below:

```bash
make build
make test
make release
```

These commands will be executed for pull requests.

## Versioning

The version of the extension is defined in the [`package.json`](./package.json) file.

Releasing in managed via [Release Please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) in the [`main.yaml`](./.github/workflows/main.yaml) workflow file.

If you need to manually trigger a release, run:

```bash
git commit --allow-empty -m "chore: release 2.0.0" -m "Release-As: 2.0.0"
```

## Releasing

When uploading a new version, follow the steps below.

### Extension Screenshots

If needed, update the screenshots. Screenshots should be 1280x800 pixels, set this in the Developer Tools (which can also be used to capture the screenshot to the Downloads folder.

Currently screenshots do not include a browser frame.

Screenshots do not have the ChatGPT sidebar, avoiding distractions.

Screenshots after the first one do not have the code sample, avoiding distractions.

Open Developer Tools, use the 'device size' button to set the responsive screen size, adjust the size to 1280x800, delete the sidebar from the nodes view, press Command+Shift+P and select 'Capture Screenshot'.

Prompts for screenshots so far are:

1. Render a flowchart showing how a browser makes a web request and a server responds. Use mermaid.js.
2. Create a UML class diagram showing relationships for the data model for a simple food delivery database. Use mermaid.js.
3. Create an architecture diagram that would show the key components in an instant messaging application, use mermaidjs.
4. Create a sequence diagram showing how retry logic with retry queues is typically implemented when using Apache Kafka, use mermaidjs for the diagram

Resize screenshots with:

```bash
brew install imagemagick

new_width=1280
for input in ./docs/screenshots/*.png; do
    [[ -f "$input" ]] || continue
    output="${input/\.png/-${new_width}.png}"
    echo "Convert: ${input} -> ${output}"
    convert "${input}" -resize "${new_width}x" "${output}"
done
```

## Task List

A quick-and-dirty list of improvements and next steps:

- [x] build: tests
- [x] build: coverage badge
- [ ] build: commitlint
- [x] build: pipeline to create package
- [x] build: release please
- [ ] docs: table of local commands
- [ ] bug: button is inserted multiple times while chatgpt is writing (add the class to the dom element _before_ start processing? note that the code language text (e.g. 'mermaid') is overwritten
- [ ] docs: table of libraries used
- [ ] feat: error handling
- [ ] feat: Create script to open a new chrome window, with the appropriate command line flags to load the dist unpacked
- [ ] feat: edit xpath queries via options page
- [ ] feat: counter for extension icon that shows number of diagrams processed
- [ ] feat: sample page rendering to speed up testing and local dev
- [ ] docs: blog post sharing extension, share online (LI, HN, Reddit)
- [x] docs: better icon - just a simple 50/50 split of the two logos down the middle, or diagonal
- [ ] bug: debugger doesn't work on chrome, seems to be a sourcemaps issue (raised as https://github.com/crxjs/chrome-extension-tools/issues/691)
- [ ] feat: Lightbox for diagrams
- [ ] feat: 'copy' button for diagrams
- [ ] improvement: use the mutation observer (see ./src/observe.js) to watch for new code samples, rather than scanning the DOM on a timer
- [ ] refactor: move rendering logic to background page (so error content is hidden in tabs)
- [ ] refactor: MD5 diagram text, use as a key for diagrams in a background page so that we don't recreate each time
- [ ] improvement: icon for 'show diagram' button
- [ ] build: resolve test issues https://github.com/dwmkerr/chatgpt-diagrams-extension/issues/6
- [ ] improvement: option in the menu screen to 'toggle' diagram, meaning that instead of the code we show the diagram only (makes it easier to take screenshots too).
