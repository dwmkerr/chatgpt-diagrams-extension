## Detailed Description

The ChatGPT Diagrams extension adds a new button to the ChatGPT website - "Show Diagram". This button appears above code samples. If your code sample is in Mermaid format (a popular text based format for diagrams) then when you press the button the diagram will be shown in-line beneath the code sample.

This is a great way to improve your interactions with ChatGPT and build and refine diagrams in real time!
